      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
        Trading STOCK MARKET can be a challenging and potentially profitable opportunity for investors/traders. However, before deciding to participate in the Futures and Options market, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. Most importantly, do not invest money you cannot afford to lose and NEVER OVERTRADE.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
        There is a considerable exposure to risk in capital markets trading. Any trading involving stocks/securities/currencies/commodities involves risks including, but not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price or liquidity of a stock/security/currency/commodity. Investments in capital markets speculation may also be susceptible to sharp rises and falls as the relevant market values fluctuate. The leveraged nature of FUTURES AND OPTIONS TRADING means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This may work against you as well as for you. Not only may investors/traders get back less than they invested, but in the case of higher risk strategies, investors/traders may lose the entirety of their investment. It is for this reason that when speculating in such markets it is advisable to use only risk capital.
